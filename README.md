## Port Scanners (Active)
### AutoRecon
AutoRecon is a multi-threaded network reconnaissance tool which performs automated enumeration of services. It is intended as a time-saving tool for use in CTFs and other penetration testing environments (e.g. OSCP). It may also be useful in real-world engagements. The tool works by firstly performing port scans / service detection scans. From those initial results, the tool will launch further enumeration scans of those services using a number of different tools. For example, if HTTP is found, feroxbuster will be launched. Runs curl, dnsrecon, enum4linux, feroxbuster, gobuster, impacket-scripts, nbtscan, nikto, nmap, onesixtyone, oscanner, redis-tools, smbclient, smbmap, snmpwalk, sslscan, svwar, tnscmd10g, whatweb, wkhtmltopdf, etc automatically.

### WhereToGo
Due to security assessments of different projects, I found different leaked/exposed accounts on the domain of the organization. But every time it was so difficult to discover the place where I can reuse those credentials and how can I expand my attack surface. I started collecting a list of popular technological services which might have high value in case of improper access. This project should help researchers, pentesters, bounty-hunters to expand the risks of compromised accounts in the corporate environment.

### Retire.js
There is a plethora of JavaScript libraries for use on the Web and in Node.JS apps out there. This greatly simplifies development,but we need to stay up-to-date on security fixes. "Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities" is now a part of the OWASP Top 10 list of security risks and insecure libraries can pose a huge risk to your Web app. The goal of Retire.js is to help you detect the use of JS-library versions with known vulnerabilities.

## Stealth
### FireProx
Being able to hide or continually rotate the source IP address when making web calls can be difficult or expensive. A number of tools have existed for some time but they were either limited with the number of IP addresses, were expensive, or required deployment of lots of VPS's. FireProx leverages the AWS API Gateway to create pass-through proxies that rotate the source IP address with every request! Use FireProx to create a proxy URL that points to a destination server and then make web requests to the proxy URL which returns the destination server response!
* https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox

It is sufficient to give to the extension the cookies of a low privileged user and navigate the website with a high privileged user. The extension automatically repeats every request with the session of the low privileged user and detects authorization vulnerabilities. It is also possible to repeat every request without any cookies in order to detect authentication vulnerabilities in addition to authorization ones.
* https://portswigger.net/bappstore/f9bbac8c4acf4aefa4d7dc92a991af2f

### Burp Bounty Scan Check Builder

This is useful to prevent our main IP address from being blacklisted by popular WAFs while performing penetration testing and bug bounty hunting.
* https://github.com/d3mondev/burp-vps-proxy

### Collaborator Everywhere
This extension augments your in-scope proxy traffic by injecting non-invasive headers designed to reveal backend systems by causing pingbacks to Burp Collaborator.

* https://portswigger.net/bappstore/aaaa60ef945341e8a450217a54a11646

### IPRotate
This extension allows you to easily spin up API Gateways across multiple regions. All the Burp Suite traffic for the targeted host is then routed through the API Gateway endpoints which causes the IP to be different on each request. (There is a chance for recycling of IPs but this is pretty low and the more regions you use the less of a chance). This is useful to bypass different kinds of IP blocking like bruteforce protection that blocks based on IP, API rate limiting based on IP or WAF blocking based on IP etc.
